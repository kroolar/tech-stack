# Command

### Problem
### Solution

**Pros:**
- You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform these operations (SRP)
- You can introduce new commands into the app without breaking existing client code (OCP)
- You can implement undo/redo
- You can implement deferred execution of operations
- You can assemble a set of simple commands into a complex one

**Cons:**
- The code may become more complicated since youâ€™re introducing a whole new layer between senders and receivers
