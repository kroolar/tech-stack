# Abstract Factory

Description

### Problem

### Solution

**Pros:**
- You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other
- You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code
- You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support (SRP)
- You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code (OCP)

**Cons:**
- The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern
