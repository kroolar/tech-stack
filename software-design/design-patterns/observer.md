# Observer

### Problem
### Solution

**Pros:**
- You can establish relations between objects at runtime
- You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface) (OCP)

**Cons:**
- Subscribers are notified in random order
