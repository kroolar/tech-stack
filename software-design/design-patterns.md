### <a name="overview">1. Overview</a>

Design pattern is a typical solution to frequently encountered problems in software development. It simply cannot be copied to the program. You can adjust it to the problem and implement an appropriate solution based on it.

### <a name="whatFor">2. What For?</a>

- They are ready-made solutions to common problems, thanks to which we can better design software
- You can use them in any object-oriented language
- They define a common language so that you can communicate better with the team
- Questions about knowing them often appear during job interviews

### <a name="classification">3. Classification</a>

- **Creational patterns** - Provide more flexible mechanism for creating objects and allow reuse of existing code
- **Structural patterns** - Explain how to create objects and classes into larger structures
- **Behavioral patterns** - They concern algorithms and the division of tasks between objects
