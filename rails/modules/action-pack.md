# Action Pack

Action Pack is responsible for handling and responding to web requests. It introduces routing, defines controllers with their actions and generates responses by rendering views. The **Action Pack** provides layers for both the controller and the view.

Action Pack consists of two modules:
- [Action Dispatch]('https://github.com/kroolar/tech-stack/blob/master/rails/modules/action-dispatch.md')
- [Action Controller]('https://github.com/kroolar/tech-stack/blob/master/rails/modules/action-controller.md')

In Ruby on Rails, the user has direct access only to the **Action Controller** module. **Action Dispatch** is automatically activated, and the **Action View** is implicitly triggered.
