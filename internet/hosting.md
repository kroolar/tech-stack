# Hosting
Hosting allows you to connect your website to the internet. In fact, it is a server or part of a server connected to the internet where you place all the files and data related to your website.

When you buy hosting, you get not only space on the server, but also additional tools, indicators, support related to security and support from the company that provides this hosting.

### What exactly is hosting?
It is a physical computer connected to the internet that works continuously and sends data about your site when someone visits it.

### Types of hosting

#### Shared Hosting
With such a service, only a part of the server is allocated to you. This means that the same server can be used by many users at the same time. It is the best choice for beginners, especially due to its price and simplicity.

Pros:
- Cost-effective, ideal for small-scale websites
- Technical expertise is not required
- Pre-configured server options
- No need to take care of maintenance and server administration

Cons:
- Minimal access to server configuration
- Increased traffic on other websites can affect your website’s speed

### Virtual Private Server(VPS)
In this case, the server is also used by many users, but we are only talking about a physical machine because a virtual space with specific resources is created for each user.

Pros:
- Dedicated server space
- Increased traffic on other websites has no impact on your site’s performance
- Root access to the server
- High customizability

Cons:
- Users need technical expertise to manage it
- Even though it’s relatively affordable, some users may have to hire a developer to manage the virtual server, increasing the overall costs

### Cloud Hosting
It is possible to rent your server in the cloud. This means that we do not implement our website on one physical server, but on physical networks and virtual machines, thanks to which we have great opportunities when it comes to scaling and flexibility.

Pros:
- Reduced likelihood of downtime and hardware failure
- Uses load balancing to handle high traffic and prevent DDoS attacks
- Scalability – your website is not limited to the resources of a single server

Cons:
- Root access is not always provided
- It is more expensive than VPS and shared hosting

### Dedicated Hosting
Renting a private server available only to you, thanks to which you have the possibility of its full configuration. This works just like buying a private server and using it, but you also get professional service to help you manage it.

Pros:
- Complete control over the server’s configuration
- High reliability
- Root access to the server

Cons:
- High cost, more oriented towards large businesses
- Technical and server management knowledge is required
